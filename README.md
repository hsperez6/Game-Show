# Game-Show
 Browser-based, word guessing game using JS and Object-Oriented Programming.  


I personalized the app style by applying a Mario theme to the game. I've replaced the background image of the starting overlay, body of the game, and the background images displayed depending on whether the player won or lost. I also replaced the blank squares of the hidden letters in the active phrase with Mario question blocks, and the life hearts with green mushrooms. Lastly, I added a dying Mario to the game over screen after the reset button.
